#### Task 1: TARGET VARIABLE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMATIONS -------------------------------------------
ggplot(allies, aes(x = likes)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Likes",
       subtitle = "The variable is skewed right, with extreme outliers.",
       x = "Likes",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
# the distribution of comment likes is heavily skewed to the right as there seems to be extreme high outliers. Thus, a transformation may be necessary to help normalize the distribution.

ggplot(allies, aes(x = log10(likes))) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Likes with a Log Transformation",
       subtitle = "The variable is still skewed right, and many values were removed.",
       x = "Likes",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
# a log transformation did seem to help to slightly normalize the likes distribution, but as there are numerous values of 0 within the observations, those values were removed

ggplot(allies, aes(x = sqrt(likes))) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Likes with a Square Root Transformation",
       subtitle = "The variable is still skewed right, and many values were removed.",
       x = "Likes",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
# sqrt transformation helped less than log


#### Task 2: DATA INSPECTION -------------------------------------------
colSums(is.na(allies))

library(knitr)

# Calculate the count of missing values for each column
missing_counts <- colSums(is.na(allies))

# Convert the result to a data frame
missing_counts_df <- data.frame(Missing_Count = missing_counts)

# Create a neat table using kable
kable(missing_counts_df)
# there only seems to be missingness in the ID of a commentâ€™s parent comment. However, this does not seem to pose a significant issue, as this variable is not going to be important for my analysis.

#### Task 3: CATEGORICAL VAR INSPECTION -------------------------------------------
ggplot(allies, aes(x = factor(comment_length, 
                              levels = c("short", 
                                         "medium", "
                                         long")))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Comment Length",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of Comment Length",
       subtitle = "There are significantly more short comments than long or medium.") +
  theme_minimal()
# class imbalance, as there are significantly more short comments than long or medium
