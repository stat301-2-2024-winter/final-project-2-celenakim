## The "allies" dataset


The data that I chose for my project was derived from gathering data on the psychological analysis of comments under the Jubilee video titled [Are We Allies? Black Americans vs Asian Americans | Middle Ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXo2ub_nZFc) found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). This video features a poignant discussion between East Asian Americans and Black Americans, highlighting the conflict and tension present between these groups. 

- `allies.csv`
- `allies.rds`
- `allies_codebook.csv`  
- `00.cleaning.R`
- `codebook_creation.R`

The original `allies_data` data set consisted of 66 variables, but I carried out a cleaning process of removing irrelevant variables/variables with missingness, mutating a categorical variable of the length of a comment, and renaming variable names to ultimately end up with 15,397 observations and 51 variables.
